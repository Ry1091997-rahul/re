This attribute defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels. The attribute is applied both horizontally and vertically,
to the space between the top of the table and the cells of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the right of the table and the last column and
the bottom of the table and the last row.To achieve a similar effect, apply the border-spacing property to the <table> element. border-spacing does not have any effect
if border-collapse is set to collapse.frame -->

  <!-- we can also make table without using "tbody tag" and "thesd tag" as seen in the below image we use "tbody and thead tag "
  for identifying body and head so that we can easily decorate it like coloring etc in the primitive time when "CSS" is not exist
  then we use this method but it is not effective way because html is only use for strucure and "CSS" is use for beautifying and
  "javascriprt" is used for action-->
